     https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/#/description

Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array),
some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses only constant auxiliary space, excluding the space needed to store the output

## Example:
```
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[2,3]
```
